This is the vocabulary list of Japanese words I put together when I was studying for the 潜水士試験. If you don't know what this means, you probably don't need to care about this repository.

If you want to study this list of vocabulary, I'm "teaching" this course on memrise (URL). Please feel free to use the lists to study.

PRs? Yes, please. Not necessarily for additional words but if you find an error (typing / content).

License: No license for this whatsoever. Not sure if lists of words can even be licensed.
